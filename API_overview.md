## About the Chronologue API
<br>

The Chronologue API is open-source software that stores data about astronomical events. You can easily query astronomical data stored in the API and visualize events on the Chronologue website. 

The main purpose of Chronologue API is to help scientists and organizations advance humanity's knowledge. To query and visualize an astronomical event, you need an HTTP client, for example, Chrome. 

Developers can contribute to the software by joining the Chronologue Project, which is part of The Good Docs project. To contribute to program code, you should be familiar with the following tools:

- Next.js
- Netlify hosting infrastructure

To learn more, join our [Slack community](https://thegooddocs.slack.com/) or attend a [Chronologue meeting](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/community/).

## Main features
<br>

The Chronologue time travel telescope records astronomical events of the past and future. It stores the events in the [data.json](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/chronologue/blob/main/data/data.json) file as event objects. You can use the Chronologue API to query exisiting astronomical events from the `data.json file`. 
If you want to retrieve data for an event that does not yet exist, you need to request a new recording. 

> Note: The Chronologue telescope predicts future events, but the accuracy of these predictions is not guaranteed. 

To use the Chronologue API, read and follow the steps described in the "Request for a new recording" document. If your request is approved, you will receive a notification email containing an API Key that gives you access to the Chronologue's API. 

The Chronologue API follows REST architecture. You can access the API's resources via HTTP requests and responses are given in JSON format.

## Common use cases
<br>

### Academic research 

Gather information with the Chronologue API to further humanity's understanding. You can visualize past events that can help you explain what circumstances caused a another phenomenon of nature. 
 
Use the Chronologue API to test your hypothesis. The Chronologue API can make predictions about future astronomical events. You can compare your predictions to those prouced by the API as a way to validate your hypothesis.

### Educational purposes

Demonstrate to your audience the causal relationship between two natural events. For example, you can show your students the asteroid's impact on Earth during the Cretaceous Period that caused the mass extinction of three-quarters of plant and animal species.
