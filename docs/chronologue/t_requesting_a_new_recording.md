Name, org, purpose, coordinates (where telescope should point to) a link of how far it should go.

Star Stories podcast on how stars are made and things like measurements in astronomy. Looking to make a form that replicates a research project.

Data has to be useful for a certain audience. Justify research for wider breadth of ppl (~100 people)

Implimentation: link in header.

Describe prerqs: be part of an org of some kind; private company? Some sort of ethics statement. Are states able to use it?

Submit. Goes to independent committee that reviews request and you'll be cued. Location, duration, points in time to gather data. "We can't grant you 2 years, but 2 weeks" There's only one teleascope, so you'll need to wait your turn.

What kind of data? Ian collected a year, place, description, link (video). All in Ian's API: event, date, image...

If you're a scientist, how do you retrieve data from API?

Visuals: Diagram: steps in process. Reviewing loop.

Divide this into several splits: requesting and retrieving, two how-to's; and a third portion for concept
