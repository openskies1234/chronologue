<!-- ## Overview --> 

This document presents concepts you need to understand before using Chronologue. The document looks at time travel and its constraints. 
<!--Add a statement about the target audience--> 
<!-- Maybe add what assumptions the document is making about the audience. Something like: The document assumes you are comfortable learning about complex topics. --> 

<!-- Are you planning to add a glossary? You could gather all the defintiions here, like Time, nonspatial, telescope, wormhole -->


## What is time? 
Time is “a nonspatial continuum” [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/time). “Nonspatial” means that time has no size, nor can it be touched. However, time can be measured in increments of different sizes, such as seconds, minutes, hours, days. To visualize time, we can read a clock or look at a calendar. Different cultures use different calendars. The Chronologue telescope uses the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar).


## What is spacetime?
Spacetime is when you combine the three spatial dimensions (3D) and time, resulting in a four-dimensional (4D) system. Since there is no exact visual representation of a 4D space, you will often see pictures like this to clarify the relationship between space and time:

Large objects, like stars and planets, impact spacetime by deforming it. Time does not progress linearly but at different speeds because of the deformation. <!-- Suggested change: Large objects, like start and planets, deform the spacetime and this deformation is proportional to the size of the object with larger objects causing more deformation. In terms of time, this means that time is nonliear as it speed of progression depends on the curvature of the spacetiume. --> This effect can be measured on earth as well. Clocks on the mean sea level work at normal speed, whereas clocks on a plane at 10,000 km go a bit slower. <!--This effect can be observed in earth where clocks on a plane at 10,000 km go a bit slower than clocks that are on the mean sea level.--> <!--An--> One episode of the TV show PBS Spacetime explains this concept well: [General Relativity & Curved Spacetime Explained!](https://youtu.be/AwhKZ3fd9JA?t=359)

## What is the Chronologue?

Chronologue consists of two things:
* The time-travel telescope
* Software to change the parameters of the time-travel telescope
<!--
Watch out for unparallel structures. 
Change suggestion: 
* A time-travel telescope. 
* A software to change the parameters of the time-travel telescope.
-->

A usual telescope allows you to see the light of stars that are many lightyears away. Because it takes a long time for the light to travel across the universe, we are not looking at the current state of this star, but the past. Let’s look at a more tangible example to clarify this phenomenon: <!-- You can replace this sentence and the explanation with the following: Is like when you detect a lag in a live streaming service.--> 
<!--Change suggestion for the first two sentences: 
The light that reaches the earth has travelled across the universe for several, sometimes millions of years. This means that the light we observe with the help of telescopes is a snapshot of the past of its source star.
--> 

<!--I think this explanation is optional--> 
You’re at home watching the football world cup via an internet stream and you notice the connection is sometimes a bit laggy. Suddenly you hear your neighbors cheer aloud but your screen only shows people chasing a football. Two seconds later, you also see that a team scored a goal. 

The time-travel telescope is an upgraded, more complex telescope that lets you **look** at the past <!--and also--> the present, and the future <!--. Moreover, the time-travel Chronologue telescope gives you access to any location in the universe-->. in any location in the universe. You can access the time-travel telescope via your browser as a viewer and look at pre-programmed time travel destinations, such as the discovery of fire. If you need to access a specific time in space, you can do so by using the Chronologue API. 

<!--If you want to integrate Chronologue within your program, have a look at the Chronologue SDK. Active development is still up for discussion...-->

## How does the Chronologue telescope work?

<!-- 
Suggestion:
In this section, you will learn how Chronologue's time-travel telescope can show you any point you want in the spacetime. 
-->

Because spacetime can be formed, the time-travel telescope can create a path between different points in spacetime, also known as a wormhole. A wormhole connects different places in space, different points in time, or both, and is often visualized as a tunnel.
<!-- what about:
The time-travel telescope software manipulates spacetime to create a path between to different points: your point and the desired point you want to look at. This path, or tunnel, is known as a wormhole.

>Note: Everything starting from here is pure fiction. <!--This was already said before-->

Since it takes a tremendous amount of energy to create a [wormhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole), there is only one time-travel telescope in the world, governed by the Chronologue project. If you want access to the time-travel telescope and run your program on it, you need to fill out a request for time-travel (RTT). The Chronologue project reviews RTTs to ensure that the time-travel telescope is used in a way that benefits humanity in the best way possible, such as:
* Academic research
* Educational purposes
* Time tourism

<!--Suggestion:
The exorbitant amount of energy required to create a wormhole hampers our ability of having more than one time-travel telescope in the world. For this reason, the Chronologue project reviews every request for time-travel (RTT) to ensure that the time-travel telescope is used to benefit humanity in the best way possible. An RTT can be filled out for one of the following reasons: 

* Academic research
* Educational purposes
* Time tourism
